## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip

Check your Python version:
```powershell
python --version
```

---

### Step 1 — Set Up the Backend

Open a terminal and run:

```powershell
cd E:\RestaurantFinder\backend
pip install fastapi uvicorn requests
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Leave this terminal open.

---

### Step 2 — Set Up the Frontend

Open a **second terminal** and run:

```powershell
cd E:\RestaurantFinder\frontend
pip install streamlit requests
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`

---

### Step 3 — Test the Backend Directly (Optional)

Open this URL in your browser to confirm the backend is working:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/restaurants?location=Thamel,Kathmandu
```

You should see a JSON response with restaurant names, distances, and details.

## API Endpoints

### Search restaurants near a location

```
GET /restaurants?location=Thamel,Kathmandu&radius=2000&keyword=momo
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| location | string | ✅ Yes | Any place name or address |
| radius | integer | No | Search radius in meters (default: 2000) |
| keyword | string | No | Filter by name or cuisine (e.g. pizza, momo) |

**Example response:**
```json
{
  "query_location": "Thamel, Kathmandu, Nepal",
  "count": 15,
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "Everest Steak House",
      "cuisine": "steak",
      "distance": "958 m",
      "duration": "2 mins",
      "opening_hours": ["Mo-Su 10:00-22:00"]
    }
  ]
}
```

```

```

## How the Data Flow Works

```
User enters location
        ↓
Nominatim converts it to lat/lng coordinates
        ↓
Overpass API finds all restaurants within the radius
        ↓
OSRM calculates driving distance and time to each one
        ↓
Results sorted by distance and displayed in the UI
        ↓
User clicks a restaurant → Overpass fetches full details
```

---

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Reason |
|---|---|
| No restaurant photos | OpenStreetMap does not store images |
| Slow first load (15–30 sec) | Overpass API is a free community server |
| Some restaurants missing info | OSM data depends on community contributions |
| Occasional timeouts | Free Overpass servers get congested |

The app automatically tries 3 different Overpass servers if one fails.

## Planned Upgrades

- [ ] Show restaurants on an interactive map (Folium)
- [ ] "Open Now" filter based on current time
- [ ] User authentication and saved favourites
- [ ] AI-powered "What should I eat tonight?" recommender
- [ ] Export results to CSV
- [ ] Deploy backend to Render.com
